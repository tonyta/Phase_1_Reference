Phase 1 Cheatsheet
=================
This is a quick reference to all the stuff we touched upon in Phase 1
##General Tips
#### MVP: *minimum* viable product
Only implement the features to spec, *nothing* more. Otherwise you are wasting precious time.

Don't get fancy until you have finished all the required work and have done as much refactoring as you can and have made certain that your classes adhere to solid OOD principles.
#### WWSMD: What Would Sandi Metz Do?
Do the responsibilities that your classes have make sense? Or should they be in other classes?

Are your methods only doing one thing?
#### Refactor, Refactor, Refactor
Okay, your code works. But is this the best, most elegant implementation? Are there any enumerable methods that makes your code more readable?
